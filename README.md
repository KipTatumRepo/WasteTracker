# WasteTracker
Custom Field Site Application for tracking waste <br/>
I am working on completing the database for this application 

This was my second major, but first after I had been hired on full time as a software developer, project while with Compass Business Intelligence.
This built for cafes in another state to use for tracking how much food they prepared, how much got used, and give a report about the percentage wasted.
This project allowed for the leadership to export the reports to Excel for printing.
